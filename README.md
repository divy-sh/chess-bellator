# Chess-Bellator

**Chess-Bellator** A chess engine built using a combination of Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The engine is designed to explore and improve strategies for playing chess with the aid of modern AI techniques.

## Features
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**: Used for evaluating positions and making move predictions.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: A method for efficiently searching the game tree by eliminating moves that cannot possibly affect the final decision.
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: A heuristic search algorithm used to simulate potential future game states and determine optimal moves.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/divy-sh/chess-bellator.git
